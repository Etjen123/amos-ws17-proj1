# Conversational Chatbot

A project for the 2017 AMOS Course in collaboration with Actano

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Deployment

To deploy the system make sure you have docker and git installed. If you do, clone this repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/amos-ws17/amos-ws17-proj1.git
```

Then navigate to the newly created _amos-ws17-proj1_ folder and type in the following command to start deploy the bots:

```
docker-compose up
```
Now all bots are running and are accesssible on those ports:
* **Weather bot:** 5012, 5015, 5010
* **Sightseeing bot:** 5022, 5025, 5020
* **Restaurant bot:** 5032

### Manual installation and deployment

Install a virtualenv in a desired location

```
sudo pip install virtualenv
#cd to our desired location
virtualenv -p python venv
```

Start your venv

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Rasa NLU

```
pip install rasa_nlu
```

Install necessary libraries

```
pip install requests 
pip install -U spacy
python -m spacy download en
pip install -U scikit-learn scipy sklearn-crfsuite
python -m pip install duckling
```

Install Rasa Core

```
pip install rasa_core
```

Now you should be able to run the [weather bot](https://github.com/amos-ws17/amos-ws17-proj1/wiki/Weather-bot).  
For more details on installing Rasa take a look into the [Rasa NLU](http://nlu.rasa.ai/installation.html) and [Rasa Core](https://core.rasa.ai/installation.html) documentation.
