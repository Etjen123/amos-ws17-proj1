## Collection of publicly available data sets

The more data the better, so if anyone finds a data set can put it here, so we dont lose any knowledge. The scale for the Integration Complexity is the following:

Easy - Either completely integratable or requires very little work

Medium - Integratable, but will require building a parser or doing it by hand

Hard - Almost impossible to integrate
